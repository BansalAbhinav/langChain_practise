Beneath the leaves, a boy once dreamed,
Of bonds unbroken, of strength redeemed.
Through shadowed paths and trials deep,
Naruto’s promise he swore to keep.

Across the seas where the sun meets sky,
A straw-hat sails with laughter high.
Through storms and islands, foes and fears,
Luffy’s will shines through the years.

One fights with chakra, a burning flame,
The other with freedom, a pirate’s name.
Though worlds apart, their hearts align,
To chase their dreams, unbound, divine.

For bonds and crews, they never cease,
Heroes of Leaf and endless seas.
Two journeys vast, yet spirits the same—
Naruto, Luffy—eternal flame.
